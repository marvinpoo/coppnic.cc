*The w!nd is the direction I am currently going. I was inspired about this by the [Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about){:target="_blank"}, a sententia to express what you are basically doing right now. As I am a pretty lazy guy when it comes to my own projects, I've modified the idea to fit into my Zen Garden. The w!nd is what currently moves me and influences my decisions. As you can imagine, winds can change their directions, split apart, come together and be whatever they want to be right now. To me, w!nd is "temporarily permanent", my most used oxymoron.*

## Wind

Currently I am moved by the seemingly ignorance and disrespect of privacy by the lawmakers. Their plans to:
* use biometric data
* weaken encryption through forcing service providers to backup a "master key" for authroities
* bypass encryption by installing keyloggers through trojans onto your device pre-encryption
* declare service providers as telecommunication providers to have more rights to gain access

are a disgusting take on mass surveiling innocent citizen and only lower the bar to extend such laws and capacities / authorities.

In the same moment they try to restrict companies (which is fine to me) to gain data of their users. Making this seem like "protecting privacy, except from us". This is making me scared to lose fundamental and general basic rights. Due to that I am currently focussed on digital privacy, data policy and civic rights. Feel free to talk to me about that topic, send me information and links to articles right into my DMs on Twitter.

## Now
### Lockdown madness

As probably almost everyone else on this planet, I am still in a medium restricted lockdown. Since 12. Jan. 2021 the Berlin Senat has passed the legal framework to restrict the movement of it's residents. To me that isn't really effecting at all, though that my [travel plans](#traveling) for this year might be in danger. The overall situation had me pretty bummed, but I've taken the opportunity to do more stuff for myself, such as creating my digital Zen Garden.

### Planning

Currently I have no plans. Thought I am thinking about participating in the local and federal elections (2021/Q3) as supporter. For current ideas and plans, check out my [s33ds](/zen/seeds/).

### Learning & collecting insight

* enhancing my JS skills
* headless CMS
* getting to know myself better
* automation
* decentralization & dWeb
* transhumanism
* maximum sustainability design-extremism
* the human species withouth planet Earth
* uniting humanity

### Doing

At this moment I am writing some articles to load some content into my Zen Garden. Also I am pretty much focussed on work right now. I should never forget in what luck I am to have work to do while a significant amount of people in my country has lost their jobs or been put into short shifts due to the pandemic situation.

### Listening

As the year is starting and everything is calm around me, I am pretty much banished into the sweet sounds of cineastic post-rock. Here are some artists I am listening to atm (random order):

* Mogwai
* Eluvium
* Sigur Rós
* Ólafur Arnalds
* Jónsi
* Múm
* Rökkurró

For more music, feel free to check out my music page in the inspiration section.

### Reading

I am still stuck in the "Foundation" Triology, by Isaac Asimov. Also reading a lot of articles about social and worklife shift due to the pandemic.

### Watching

I've just finished **Borgen**, the 3rd season of **Star Trek: Discovery** (*yes, I've enjoyed it, unironically*), **The Queen's Gambit** and the 6th season of **Brooklyn 99**. Currently I am looking forward to find some new show to commit to.

Here are some movies I've recently (re)watched and enjoyed:
* The Hater (*drama, thriller*)
* This Is The End (*comedy*)
* The Girl in the Spider's Web (*nerdy action thriller*)
* 1917 (*war drama*)
* Beautiful Boy (*drug drama*)

### Traveling

Due to the pandemic situation, my annual trip to my natural hideout in Brandenburg is probably going to be cancelled. In the recent years I have enjoyed this little refugium close to Berlin but far from the chaotic life in my hometown. Damn, I really hope I can visit there this year.
