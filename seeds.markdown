*To finish it off, s33ds are ideas that I have and that I want to try. Over time these seeds will prosper to beautiful plants.*

### Zen Garden
My digital Zen Garden is my first seed. Currently it is also the most grown seed, quite like a tiny little sapling. Based on the infamous "release early, release often" modell, I am adding, editing and deleting features and ideas of this project.

**Phase:** Launched. Growing.

**Situation:** If you can read this, this seed has been planted and is about to grow into a beautiful plant. I am currently collecting feedback.

### ~~Autonomous terrarium~~
*Due to the change of the relationship-status of my friends, this project is postponed without a new date.*

### Leaving Big-Corp Tech
As surveillance is rising and the abuse of humans private data, I've decided to slowly leave the big-corp tech world. At this moment I am using my Raspi 4+[^1] to set up my personal structure for tools such as IDE's, password managers, calendars and more. The next step will be leaving plattforms such as Facebook, Discord and co.

**Phase:** Working on.

**Situation:** Currently I have moved all my communication to open source and encrypted messengers. I am currently shifting my Google data e/OS/[^2] and it's ecosystem. This goes hand in hand with switching from my Huawei phone to a Fairphone 3+[^3].
