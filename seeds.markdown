*To finish it off, s33ds are ideas that I have and that I want to try. Over time these seeds will prosper to beautiful plants.*

### Zen Garden
My digital Zen Garden is my first seed. Currently it is also the most grown seed, quite like a tiny little sapling. Based on the infamous "release early, release often" modell, I am adding, editing and deleting features and ideas of this project.

**Phase:** Launched. Growing.

**Situation:** If you can read this, this seed has been planted and is about to grow into a beautiful plant. I am currently collecting feedback.

### Autonomous terrarium
Friends of mine have adopted two male and four female geckos in early 2020. Currently we are planning the remodelling of their terrarium. We are planning to make it fully autonomously, with the backup possibility of manual interfering in case of a malfunction of the autonomous system. The automation is supposed to control and set the temperature, humidity and lighting of the terrarium. 

**Phase:** Working on.

**Situation:** Currently we are looking for heat lamps that have open protocolls or API's. We will use a Raspi[^1] with a self-coded automation OS that can be controlled via a local device and remote protocolls protected by **AES-256 bit**[^2] encryption to control it with trusted devices outside of the local network. We have already wired up the temperature-, humidity- and light sensors and work on combining these to receive data which will then be translated and fed to a, yet to code, control system.

### Leaving Big-Corp Tech
As surveillance is rising and the abuse of humans private data, I've decided to slowly leave the big-corp tech world. At this moment I am using my Raspi 4+ to set up my personal structure for tools such as IDE's, password managers, calendars and more. The next step will be leaving plattforms such as Facebook, Discord and co.

**Phase:** Working on.

**Situation:** I have finished setting up my local Raspi and fed it with open source tools to manage my every-day things. As of march 2021 I have left WhatsApp. You can now find me on Telegram, Signal, Threema and, if you really have no other tools, Wickr. (Damn, Wickr is so sketchy and awkward.)
