*To finish it off, s33ds are ideas that I have and that I want to try. Over time these seeds will prosper to beautiful plants.*

### Leaving Big-Corp Tech
As surveillance is rising and the abuse of humans private data, I've decided to slowly leave the big-corp tech world. At this moment I am using my Raspi 4+[^1] to set up my personal structure for tools such as IDE's, password managers, calendars and more. The next step will be leaving plattforms such as Facebook, Discord and co.

**Phase:** Working on.

**Situation:** 
***Q4/2021:*** Currently I have moved all my communication to open source and encrypted messengers. I am currently shifting my Google data e/OS/[^2] and it's ecosystem. This goes hand in hand with switching from my Huawei phone to a Fairphone 3+[^3].

***Q1/2022:*** I've set up my Urbit (~sibnup-litdev) and am using it frequently. Additionally to leaving WhatsApp in mid 2021, I've finally left Facebook & Instagram behind me. My E-Mails are mostly hosted by e.email instead of gmail. I've reduced my twitter usage and am still searching for a good fediverse instance.

***Q2/2022:*** I moved to the fediverse instance of "A Quiet Place". 

### Color Tiles
Currently I am workinging on [Color Tiles](/garden/plants/color-tiles/)<br>
It is a webservice, mostly for myself, to catalogue my most used colors and create collections out of it. I also plan to let it create .scss files to quickstart brandings of web projects. Color Tiles will be open source as soon as I've finished the beta.
